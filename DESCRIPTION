Description: Computes several change detection metrics based on a BFAST change detection framework for breakpoints ocurring
during a given time period specified by the user (i.e. in our case years of a known drought). In addition, the overall number 
of breakpoints in the time series is extracted. Can be applied to individual pixel as well as to gridded time-series data. The
included functions were designed for exploring the use of a breakpoint model to study the response of vegetation to drought and 
climatic perturbartions. Please note that some of the extracted change detection metrics are at an experimental stage.

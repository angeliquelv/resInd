Description: Computes several change detection metrics based on a BFAST (Break for Additive Season and Trend) 
change detection framework. These change detection metrics are calculated for breakpoints occurring during a 
given time period specified by the user (i.e. during a known drought). In addition, data about the full time 
series is extracted: the overall number of breakpoints as well as the overall mean and initial value of the 
dependent time series data. The included functions were designed for exploring the use of a breakpoint model 
to study the response of vegetation to drought and climatic perturbartions. Please note that some of the 
extracted change detection metrics are at an experimental stage.
